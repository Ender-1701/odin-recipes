    <h2>Description.</h2>
    <p>Snickerdoodles are soft, slightly tangy cookies coated in cinnamon-sugar. Because they're rolled and covered in cinnamon-sugar, snickerdoodles tend to have a cracked appearance when they're fully baked. Nobody quite knows where the cookie got its name, but some speculate it comes from ​​"schneckennudel" (a cinnamon-spiked German dessert).</p>
